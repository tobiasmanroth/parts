(ns parts.ring.command-endpoint
  "The command HTTP POST endpoint is used by the client to send commands to the
   backend. A command is the data required to perform a side-effect. A request
   payload look like this:

       {:command/kind :command/team-add-user
        :command/data {:email \"joe@example.com\"}}

   Use the system register to register command handlers. Example:

       {:command/kind :command/team-add-user
        :command/fn #'command!}

   The `:command/fn` gets passed a world-value with the `:command` as entry (the
   payload of the request body). It should add a `:command/result` entry to the
   world-value, which should contain a `:success?` entry and optionally a
   `:result` entry. Example:

       {:success? false
        :result {:error \"Invalid email address\"}}

   Surround `prepare` with your Ring handler and authentication parts. Write
   your own `prepare` function if you want to use something else than
   transit+json to encode the request and response params. The `:command/fn` is
   responsible to handle the authorization."
